# Background Music Tracks

## Instructions

Place your 4 background music tracks in this folder.

### File Requirements:
- **Format**: MP3, WAV, or M4A
- **Number**: 4 tracks
- **Naming**: Any names (e.g., track1.mp3, track2.mp3, etc.)
- **Length**: Any length (will be automatically trimmed to match vocals)
- **Quality**: Recommended 192kbps or higher

### Supported Formats:
- `.mp3` - MP3 audio
- `.wav` - WAV audio
- `.m4a` - M4A/AAC audio
- `.ogg` - OGG Vorbis audio

### How It Works:
1. System randomly selects one of your 4 tracks
2. Trims it to match the exact length of the generated vocals
3. Mixes it with the vocals at appropriate volume
4. Creates the final song

### Example Structure:
```
background_music/
├── README.md (this file)
├── track1.mp3
├── track2.mp3
├── track3.mp3
└── track4.mp3
```

### Tips:
- Use upbeat, kid-friendly instrumental music
- Avoid tracks with vocals (will clash with generated vocals)
- Keep consistent volume across all 4 tracks
- Instrumental nursery rhyme style works best
